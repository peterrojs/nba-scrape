# nba-scrape

Web scraping 3PA data for a player from [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/).

## Why?
A take-home project by [Lit-Transit](https://lit-transit.com/).
The instructions can be found [here](./LIT%20programming%20task_Java.pdf)

## Usage
```shell
$ nba-scrape Luka Doncic
2020-21 - 10.9
2019-20 - 8.9
```

## Notes
* The CLI uses Selenium and a chromedriver for Chrome 91, so Chrome 91 needs to be installed for the CLI to work
